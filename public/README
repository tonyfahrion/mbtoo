Structure
====================
  => templates/
    Here we have our html-pages. There has to be a subfolder with the template-name.
    Please use *default* as reference.
  => css/
    Here we have our CSS stylesheets - also in a subfolder.
    Please use *default* as reference.
  => compiled/
    We're using smarty to generate our HTTP-output and smarty needs a directory where it is able to store the compiled templates.
    So, this would smartys compiled-dir.
  => js/
    Okay, our javascript-directory. But only for our selfscripted js-files. jQuery(UI) would stored in external!
